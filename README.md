**Objective**: This assignment aims to retrieve text articles from a provided URL and conduct text analysis. The analysis aims to calculate specific variables, details of which will be explained later. 

**Project Overview**: Utilizing Selenium for data extraction and NLTK for text analysis, this project delves into the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Employing a robust pipeline, we extract relevant data from the web and subject it to thorough analysis. From uncovering semantic nuances to sentiment analysis, the integration of these tools provides a comprehensive understanding of textual content. 
**Core Components**: Data Extraction and Text Analysis

1.**Data Extraction**: In this phase of the project, we leverage the capabilities of Selenium, a powerful web automation tool. Our approach involves utilizing Selenium to navigate and interact with web pages dynamically. Through this process, we efficiently extract relevant data from target websites, ensuring a robust and comprehensive collection of information. The use of Selenium streamlines the extraction process, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in capturing data from diverse online sources. 
Steps: 
1. WebDriver Setup: Initialize a headless Chrome WebDriver using Selenium with specified options.
 2. Data Extraction Function: Create a function to navigate to a URL, extract content based on class names, and save it to a text file.
2. Excel Data Retrieval: Read URLs and IDs from an input Excel file using Pandas. 
3. URL Iteration: Iterate through each URL, extract data, and generate unique text files based on IDs.
4. Exception Handling: Use try-except blocks to handle extraction exceptions, attempting alternative class names if needed.
 6. Output Directory Setup: Create an "output_files" directory for storing generated text files. 
5. Empty File Handling: Generate an em




2. **Text-Analysis**: Introduction to Text Analysis
 Steps: The text analysis process involves two major components: Sentimental Analysis and Analysis of Readability. Sentimental Analysis determines the positivity or negativity of the text, while Readability Analysis assesses the complexity and structure of the text. 
Sentimental Analysis Steps: 
• Cleaning with Stop Words Lists: Utilize Stop Words Lists to clean the text for Sentiment Analysis, excluding common words. 
• Positive and Negative Word Dictionary: Create a dictionary of Positive and Negative words using the Master Dictionary, excluding those in Stop Words Lists. 
• Extracting Derived Variables: Tokenize the text using NLTK, calculate Positive Score, Negative Score, Polarity Score, and Subject


Readability Analysis Steps:
 • Gunning Fox Index: Calculate Average Sentence Length, Percentage of Complex Words, and Fog Index using the Gunning Fox Index formula. 
 • Average Number of Words Per Sentence: Determine the average number of words per sentence.
  • Complex Word Count: Identify and count complex words (words with more than two syllables).
   • Word Count: Count the total cleaned words, excluding stop words and punctuation.
    • Syllable Count Per Word: Calculate the number of syllables in each word, handling exceptions
• Personal Pronouns: Use regex to count occurrences of personal pronouns, excluding exceptions like the country name "US." 
• Average Word Length: Calculate the average word length in the text. These steps collectively provide insights into sentiment and readability aspects of the analyzed text.
These steps collectively provide insights into sentiment and readability aspects of the analyzed text.
